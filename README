Now uses rb_thread_blocking_region to read events (not for sixaxis).
That way you can read events in another thread without locking up the whole RVM:

  dev = Rjoystick::Device.new '/dev/input/js0'

  Thread.new do
    dev.event
  end

  which is useful when you want to build another object that
  holds the current joystick state to be queried anytime.

Rjoystick - Ruby c binding to linux/joystick event

		FIRST OF ALL
thanks to Ruby core developer, Linux kernel developer and
Pascal at http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html
and to other people...and code that help me out.

------------------------------------------------------
This is a very small code to read input/joystick information
like pressing buttons on joysticks( PS3 Sixaxis too :)! )
to get things working i used jstest as example from Vojtech Pavlik
and sixaxis patch from www.pabr.org

This Ruby extension is written in C and works only on Linux systems.
I have tested on Debian 4.0 and Ubuntu 8.04.
To install the code just run:
	# ruby extconf.rb
	# make
	# ruby example.rb

1st example works ok with all joysticks that are good for linux.
2nd example is only for PlayStation 3(copyright Sony) Sixaxis controller
because gets 3-Axis accelerometer values and to get it works follow
this tutorial first https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sixaxis and
you can use it in BT mode :)


Sixaxis has a gyroscope but for now you can't get values from it with
this extension...maybe in a future realease :) !!
